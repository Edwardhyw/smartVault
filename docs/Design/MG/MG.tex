\section{Introduction}

Decomposing a system into modules is a commonly accepted approach to developing
software.  A module is a work assignment for a programmer or programming
team~\citep{ParnasEtAl1984}.  We advocate a decomposition
based on the principle of information hiding~\citep{Parnas1972a}.  This
principle supports design for change, because the ``secrets'' that each module
hides represent likely future changes.  Design for change is valuable in SC,
where modifications are frequent, especially during initial development as the
solution space is explored.  

Our design follows the rules layed out by \citet{ParnasEtAl1984}, as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item System details that are likely to change independently should be the
  secrets of separate modules.
\item Each data structure is implemented in only one module.
\item Any other program that requires information stored in a module's data
  structures must obtain it by calling access programs belonging to that module.
\end{itemize}

After completing the first stage of the design, the Software Requirements
Specification (SRS), the Module Guide (MG) is developed~\citep{ParnasEtAl1984}. The MG
specifies the modular structure of the system and is intended to allow both
designers and maintainers to easily identify the parts of the software.  The
potential readers of this document are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item New project members: This document can be a guide for a new project member
  to easily understand the overall structure and quickly find the
  relevant modules they are searching for.
\item Maintainers: The hierarchical structure of the module guide improves the
  maintainers' understanding when they need to make changes to the system. It is
  important for a maintainer to update the relevant sections of the document
  after changes have been made.
\item Designers: Once the module guide has been written, it can be used to
  check for consistency, feasibility and flexibility. Designers can verify the
  system in various ways, such as consistency among modules, feasibility of the
  decomposition, and flexibility of the design.
\end{itemize}

The rest of the document is organized as follows. Section 4 lists the likely and unlikely changes of the software requirements. Section 5 gives a detailed description of the
modules. Section 6 describes the use relation between modules. Section 7 specifies the connections between the software requirements and the modules and includes two traceability matrices. One checks
the completeness of the design against the requirements provided in the SRS. The
other shows the relation between anticipated changes and the modules. 

\section{Likely and Unlikely Changes} \label{SecChange}

This section lists possible changes to the system. According to the likeliness
of the change, the possible changes are classified into two
categories. Likely changes are listed in Section \ref{SecLchange}, and
unlikely changes are listed in Section \ref{SecUchange}.

\subsection{Likely Changes} \label{SecLchange}

Likely changes are the source of the information that is to be hidden
inside the modules. Ideally, changing one of the likely changes will only
require changing the one module that hides the associated decision. The approach
adapted here is called design for change.\\\\
\textbf{LC1:} The camera may get upgraded and replaced with the one with higher resolution to achieve more accurate images.\\
\textbf{Rationale:} To ensure that Image Processing Module could collect clear information with high resolution.\\\\
\textbf{LC2:} The security of user’s private account will be strengthened. \\
\textbf{Rationale:} It is necessary to safely protect the private information of the users’.\\\\
\textbf{LC3:} The specific
hardware on which the software is running.\\\\
\textbf{LC4:} The algorithm of Image Processing Module and Information Storage Module might be optimized.\\
\textbf{Rationale:} To accurately execute the task and efficiently track the missing item.\\\\
\textbf{LC5:} Any one except for the users is not allowed to access the any file that stores the information about the objects in the room.\\\\
\textbf{LC6:} The device is supposed to work in only indoor space.\\
\textbf{Rationale:} To ensure that the system is able to adapt multiple environment.\\



\subsection{Unlikely Changes}  \label{SecUchange}

The module design should be as general as possible. However, a general system is
more complex. Sometimes this complexity is not necessary. Fixing some design
decisions at the system architecture stage can simplify the software design. If
these decision should later need to be changed, then many parts of the design
will potentially need to be modified. Hence, it is not intended that these
decisions will be changed.\\\\
\textbf{UC1:} The maintenance for the device should be done by the developers.\\\\
\textbf{UC2:} The performance of the product should not violate the laws that protect the privacy of the user. \\
\textbf{Rationale:} To ensure that the private information of the users’is safely protected.\\\\
\textbf{UC3:} The device is supported by any computers supports both C and python programming languages.\\\\
\textbf{UC4:} The device should be easy to installed in the room.\\
\textbf{Rationale:} To satisfy the convenience of the installation of the device.\\\\
\textbf{UC5:} The device should not have exposed internal electronic wiring.\\\\
\textbf{UC6:} The base of the device should be strong enough without falling from the floor.\\
\textbf{Rationale:} To ensure that the base of the system is stable enough to avoid any accidents\\

in a hierarchy decomposed by secrets in Table \ref{TableMS}. The modules listed

\section{Relationship Between Modules} 

In this section, the uses hierarchy between modules is
provided. \citet{Parnas1978} said of two programs A and B that A {\em uses} B if
correct execution of B may be necessary for A to complete the task described in
its specification. That is, A {\em uses} B if there exist situations in which
the correct functioning of A depends upon the availability of a correct
implementation of B.  Figure \ref{FigUH} illustrates the use relation between
the modules. It can be seen that the graph is a directed acyclic graph
(DAG). Each level of the hierarchy offers a testable and usable subset of the
system, and modules in the higher level of the hierarchy are essentially simpler
because they use modules from the lower levels.\\
\\
In summary, the user has to login into the account through Login Module M1. Then, he or she is expected to look for the desired item using Information Extraction Module M4 with multiple searching keys. The information and data are stored in Information Storage Module M2 and progressed by Image Processing Module M3. In addition, the data transmission between the hardware-end and the software-end is connected with Communication Port 1 Module M5 and Communication Port 2 Module M6. The motor is controlled and operated by Motor Control Module M7.
