\section{Purpose}

This Document mainly talks about the design of the project, including the behavior, variables and interfaces used in the design. It will also talk about the design of the hardware component of the object, with some electrical components used and some communication protocols in the design.

\section{Scope}

The system will be designed to track the movement of the object to get the latest location information about it so that the user can always get the desired output. The user will be able to login and start the program through their own username and password. Then the information about the object will be detected through some image processing algorithms and will be stored into certain files. The user can locate desired objects through the searching interface by providing several searching keys. 


\subsection{Context Diagram}

The following pictures shows the design of the context diagram of the project. In this diagram, the user can interact with the SmartVault by logging in and provide key information about the object and SmartVault will output searching results to the user. There will be a camera located in the room that will keep sending images to SmartVault used for image processing. The motor will interact with SmartVault so to change the angular position of the camera. SmartVault will send or update information stored in the database. It will also extract desired information from the database.

\section{Project Overview}
The purpose of this project is to create a system that help the user to locate their belongs in a certain space. SmartVault will allow user to login and start the camera, by detecting the movement of the object dynamically, it will keep recording and updating positional information about the objects that are detected in the camera. Then user can detect the position of the object by sorting through the database with certain searching information.
\subsection{Normal Behaviour}
SmartVault will start operating once the user login successfully and provide technical support when the user needs. It will store the position information of objects in the database for further use. The movement of the camera is controlled by the motor so that the monitoring angle will always in best angle. It will automatically detect the movement of object using image processing method. The rotation of the motor is controlled by the human detection module which always make the camera track the motion of human. The 3D-printed camera mount will hold the motor together and map the rotation of motor to the movement of camera. To achieve different behaviours, different components are describes in the table below with their purpose.

\section{User Interfaces}

Two user interfaces will be used for this project, one is for the user to login and the other is used for searching the position information of the desired object. This section will mainly talks about these two interfaces in the following paragraphs. 

\subsection{Login Interface}
The Login Interface is used to show let the user start the program. It will also provide the contact information of the technical support. The picture shown below describes the FSM of the Login Interface. When the user starts the program ans enters correct username and password, the original window quits and comes up with the Search Window. If the user enters wrong username or passsword, the wondown will not change and asks the user to retry. If the user want to get the technical support, the Technical Support will come up. 

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.8]{FSM1.png}
    \caption{The Design of Welcome Window}
\end{figure}

WHen it comes to the Design of Window, the first one is the Welcome Window. The Welcome Window asks the user to input the username and password. If the user enters correct username and password, the window is closed and the Confirmation Windown will come up, which will be described in the paragraphs below. The Technical Support Window gives the emails of each team member. The Design of Welcome and Technical Support Window is shown in the pictures below. 

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.8]{Welcome.png}
    \caption{The Design of Welcome Window}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.8]{Technical.png}
    \caption{The Design of Technical Support Window}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Searching Interface}

The Searching Interface is used to help the user to locate the position of the object. The picture shown below describe the FSM of the project. After the program starts, the image processing method will be used to record initial condition of the object detected in the roon through the image taken by the camera. The program will wait for further changes. The motor will rotate the camera if the user detected is not in the certer of the camera or certain percentage of area of the images is blocked. When the movement of an object is detected, if it is moved by human, the program will track the movement of hands and update the information stored in the database. If it is moved by other objects, the program will only update it final state. The data base willl only record the object that moves in the area. When the user want to search certain object, the program will allow the user to input some information about the object like the approximate time. Then a list of pictures meets the information will be provided and wait for the user to choose. If the desired object is within the list and the user has confirmed it, the algorithm will finish. If the object is not found, the initial pictures will be pulled out and let the user to choose. The object is marked "Taken out" if the object is still not found. 

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.8]{FSM.png}
    \caption{The Finite State Machine of Searching Interface}
\end{figure}

For the searching interface of this project, the window will come up after the use has successfully logging into the system. A simple design of that interface is shown in the figure below. On the left hand side the images taken by the camera will be shown. On the right hand side, the object-searching algorithm will be used. If the user want to search for one desired object, the system will ask the user to input several informations about that object. After user has finished entering the information and press search, a new window will appear. It will provide several pictures that meets the input information. After the user has confirmed the final result, the result window will come up with the information that the user needs about the object.
If the user press "Object not Found ?" button, another confirmation window with the same payttern will come up but with pictures that present the initial condition. An error window is designed to tell the user that the object may be taken out by human. It will aso leave a button to return to the Searching Window.

\section{Mechanical Hardware}
Mechanical hardware consists of two mounting brackets. First part fix the position of the camera and connect with the stepper motor who controls vertical motion. Second part is connected with the stepper motor who controls horizontal motion. Part one is fixed to the part two by a rod. The horizontal-motion stepper motor act as the base of the system. The mounting bracket will be 3D-printed with PLA to minimize the weight.

\section{Electrical Components}
The electrical components include 1 Arduino board, 2 stepper motors, 2 ULN2003 drivers and 1 camera. The motor driver simplify the control process of the stepper motor and save the physical space of the hardware. The Arduino board send signal to control the stepper motor.
\section{Communication Protocols}
The serial communication protocol in the project guarantee the communication between software and hardware. The project uses python serial library to send the serial signal to the Arduino board. The communication is one-way direction which means the Arduino only receive the signal from software system but not send any signal back to the system.
