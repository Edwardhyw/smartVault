\section{Purpose}

This Document mainly talks about the design of the project, including the behavior, variables and interfaces used in the design. It will also talk about the design of the hardware component of the object, with some electrical components used and some communication protocols in the design.

\section{Scope}

The system will be designed to track the movement of the object to get the latest location information about it so that the user can always get the desired output. The user will be able to login and start the program through their own username and password. Then the information about the object will be detected through some image processing algorithms and will be stored into certain files. The user can locate desired objects through the searching interface by providing several searching keys. 


\subsection{Context Diagram}

The following pictures shows the design of the context diagram of the project. In this diagram, the user can interact with the SmartVault by logging in and provide key information about the object and SmartVault will output searching results to the user. There will be a camera located in the room that will keep sending images to SmartVault used for image processing. The motor will interact with SmartVault so to change the angular position of the camera. SmartVault will send or update information stored in the database. It will also extract desired information from the database.

\end{figure}

\section{Project Overview}
The purpose of this project is to create a system that help the user to locate their belongs in a certain space. SmartVault will allow user to login and start the camera, by detecting the movement of the object dynamically, it will keep recording and updating positional information about the objects that are detected in the camera. Then user can detect the position of the object by sorting through the database with certain searching information.
\subsection{Normal Behaviour}
SmartVault will start operating once the user login successfully and provide technical support when the user needs. It will store the position information of objects in the database for further use. The movement of the camera is controlled by the motor so that the monitoring angle will always in best angle. It will automatically detect the movement of object using image processing method. The rotation of the motor is controlled by the human detection module which always make the camera track the motion of human. The 3D-printed camera mount will hold the motor together and map the rotation of motor to the movement of camera. If the user want to find objects inside the room, the Information Extraction Module will help to present the result to the user. To achieve different behaviours, different components are describes in the table below with their purpose.

\subsection{Undesired Event Handling}

The undesired event can happen in both software and hardware part. In the software part, the undesired event may happen when two pictures with the almost the same shapes may be presented to user and it makes the user hard to decide which one is the object the user want to find. In this case, the program will keep the search window and let the user to choose both of the pictures and find their final locations to find which is the desired one. It may also happens that the on the reported location the user cannot find the desired object. In this case the user can ask the program to show the whole picture of the final movement of the object to see where is the final appearance of that object.\\
When it comes to the hardware part of the object,the undesired event may happen when the camera does not follow the movement of the user. To solve this problem, a constant is set to determine the maximum distance between the human body and the center of the picture. When the distance is over the threshold the program will force the camera to move. When other undesired event happends during the using of the project, the user can report the error to the program developer through the Technical Support Window.

\section{User Interfaces}

Two user interfaces will be used for this project, one is for the user to login and the other is used for searching the position information of the desired object. This section will mainly talks about these two interfaces in the following paragraphs. 

\subsection{Login Interface}
The Login Interface is used to let the user start the program. It will also provide the contact information of the technical support. The picture shown below describes the FSM of the Login Interface. When the user starts the program ans enters correct username and password, the original window quits and comes up with the Search Window. If the user enters wrong username or passsword, the window will not change and asks the user to retry. If the user want to get the technical support, the Technical Support will come up. 

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.6]{FSM1.png}
    \caption{The Design of Welcome Window}
\end{figure}

When it comes to the Design of Window, the first one is the Welcome Window. The Welcome Window asks the user to input the username and password. If the user enters correct username and password, the window is closed and the Confirmation Window will come up, which will be described in the paragraphs below. The Technical Support Window gives the emails of each team member. The Design of Welcome and Technical Support Window is shown in the pictures below. 

\begin{figure}[H]

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.8]{Technical.png}
    \caption{The Design of Technical Support Window}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Searching Interface}

The Searching Interface is used to help the user to locate the position of the object. The picture shown below describe the FSM of the project. After the program starts, it will first wait for further changes. The motor will rotate the camera if the user detected is not in the center of the camera. When the user leave the room at the first time, the program will record the initial condition of the room. When the user leave the room twice or more, the new captured image will be compared with the initial one and all of the object detected to be added or moved will be concluded by the image processing module and send to file storage module to update the file. When the user want to search certain object, the program will allow the user to input some information about the object like the approximate time. Then a list of pictures meets the information will be provided and wait for the user to choose. If the desired object is within the list and the user has confirmed it, the algorithm will show the location of the chosen object. The object will not be marked in the image if it is recognized as taken out of the room.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.8]{FSM.png}
    \caption{The Finite State Machine of Searching Interface}
\end{figure}

For the searching interface of the program, the search window will come up after the user has successfully logging into the system. A simple design of the search window is shown below. In that search window, the user will choose a value from the choose box to select the presence of objects in that time interval. After user has finished entering the information and press search, a new window will appear. It will provide several pictures that meets the input information. The user can use previous or next button to change the image shown to the user. If the user confirms the object image and press the confirmation button, the output window will be shown with another image. The item will be marked inside that image. If the object is marked as not found, no marking will be shown on that image. The design of those images are shown below.

\section{Design of Hardware}
The hardware part consists of motor, Arduino contoller board, camera and mount.Arduino controller board is used to communicate with PC and driven by the functionality input by the user. Two stepper motors will be used for horizontal motion and vertical motion respectively. Camera is directly connected to PC to display the video in the user interface. Mount is designed to meet the requirement which can fix both the camera and the motors and capable of three-dimension movement. Further details will be described in below subsections.
\subsection{Servo Motors}

\section{Interface}

Both of the interface provide different services to the user. The Login Interface helps protect the privacy of the user and gives the user a convenient way to contect with the program developer. The Searching Interface provides an understandable searching path to let the user quickly find the object they want to search. 

\section{Mechanical Hardware}
Mechanical hardware consists of two mounting brackets. First part fix the position of the camera and connect with the stepper motor who controls vertical motion. Second part is connected with the stepper motor who controls horizontal motion. Part one is fixed to the part two by a rod. The horizontal-motion stepper motor act as the base of the system. The mounting bracket will be 3D-printed with PLA to minimize the weight.

\section{Electrical Components}
The electrical components include 1 Arduino board, 2 stepper motors, 2 ULN2003 drivers and 1 camera. The motor driver simplify the control process of the stepper motor and save the physical space of the hardware. The Arduino board send signal to control the stepper motor.
\section{Communication Protocols}
The serial communication protocol in the project guarantee the communication between software and hardware. The project uses python serial library to send the serial signal to the Arduino board. The communication is one-way direction which means the Arduino only receive the signal from software system but not send any signal back to the system.
\section{Reflection}
\subsection{LO\_ProbSolutions}
\hspace*{1cm}The first limitation is the detection area of the camera. As described in the previous sections, the system will first capture a photo of the environment and wait for changes to proceed with further operations including the detection of human movement. However, the restriction of the detection area can not be avoided under the usage of the webcam in this project. The assumption of this project is that the hardware system is fixed in the top corner of a room. There will always exist blind angle such that the camera will not fully capture the initial state of the environment or even later states if any movement is happening outside of the first frame. A potential improvement for this limitation would be using a fisheye camera which will definitely takes more costs and narrow the design to fully software implementation. The second approach would be assigning periodic scanning of the environment to the system with the same equipment using in current design. It will solve the detection area restriction and male the project more ideal if not considering physical damage that could possible occure more frequently with more movements involved.
\\\hspace*{1cm}Second limitation is the sensitivity of the object and motion detection. The sensitivity is highly connected with the size of the library using. The assumption of the working condition for the system is ideal that each object can be identified clearly with their unique properties if it is captured in the frame and possible human-driven movement will only occur once at a time. A possible ideal improvement would be using a long-time trained mature library that can clearly identify each object and their unique properties. 
\subsection{LO\_Explores}
\hspace*{1cm}For software system, image processing module is the most controversial part. One of the design solution regarding object detection was periodically capturing frames and keep storing in the database. Instead of capturing new frames after detecting movements, it is capable of dealing with situation where multiple movements detected at the same time. But the tradeoff is processing time consuming and overflow of the data storage. The advantage for the current selected design is faster processing time for searching objects and stabilized behavior for long-time working. 
\\\hspace*{1cm}For hardware system, the choice of motor selection and design of mount has also changed. One solution for the motor is using spherical motor which makes it easy to design the mount. But the real-time control is hard to implement. Current selected design choice using two stepper motors to achieve the spherical motion coverage which is easier to control and debug. The intention for choosing this design is the solution after comparing the effort put in disng of electronic system and mechanical system.
