\section{Introduction}
This document describes the components making up the system and identify the possible hazardous behavior that could cause functional issue and safety problem. The Failure Modes and Effects Analysis method are being used in this document to clearly identify possible hazardous behaviors and the recommended actions that could be done to reduce the risk level. The system is meant to be implemented to help people locate items they have difficulty remembering. The mean function of this system are object recognition and item tracking which is used to satisfy daily-life need instead of industrial level. Safety requirement is crucial to be satisfied in the case users are considered to be non-professional. In the follow sections, all components of the system and hazards caused by the failure will be taken into consideration and methods can be applied in each case to solve the issue will also be clarified.
\section{Scope}
The scope of this hazard analysis document is to include all potential hazard relating to both hardware and software component of the project. 
\section{Component Overview}
The project can be divided into five different main components. Those components are listed in the paragraphs below.
\subsection{Movement of Camera}
A stable and accurate motorized camera mount is necessary for the movement tracking. The servos need to move in a appropriate speed and angle in order to make the camera capture the best view of both objects and user.
\subsection{Human Body Detection}
A good detection method should be used so that the human body can be detected by the program in the images provided by the camera. The movement of the human body should also need to be detected to help the camera to judge its angular position.
\subsection{User Interface}
This component provides a communication layer between the system and the user through a computer app.
\subsection{Database}
A fast and accurate data flow is the cornerstone for a system to be able to work properly and meet and requirements. The design and implementation of database is playing a major role in the whole system design.
\subsection{Objection Detection}
This system is responsible for detecting any moving object in the area and identifying each object with unique set of characteristics. The is the main logical system for smartVault to help locate a “lost” item.
\section{Critical Assumptions}
Critical assumptions that are made are: \\
CA1: Camera is mounted in a safe environment. \\
CA2: The computer device deploying SmartVault is in good condition.

\section{Safety and Security Requirements}
\subsection{Safety Requirements}
\subsubsection{SR1}
The device will stop if the motor is overloaded or has an abnormal rotation speed.\\
Rationale: It should be able to set a maximum and minimum speed for the motor. As long as the speed exceeds the range, send an error and auto adjust the speed.\\
Associated Hazards: H1-1, H1-5
\subsubsection{SR2}
The device will return an error message when the connection is unstable and tries to reconnect if possible.\\
Rationale: The user should be notified if the connection is unstable or loose. Users should not have to manually reconnect for every connection issue.\\
Associated Hazards: H1-3, H1-4
\subsubsection{SR3}
The device will return an error message if the object or human is unable to be detect or false detection.\\
Rationale: Detection may fail due to various reasons, and the user should be made aware of the issue. If detection is failed, system will be unable to find lost item.\\
Associated Hazards: H2-2, H5-2
\subsubsection{SR4}
The device will return an error message when the image processing is failed.\\
Rationale: Object identification may fail due to various reasons, and the user should be notified if the identification is failed, and notice the underlying cause behind it.\\
Associated Hazards: H2-1, H5-2
\subsubsection{SR5}
The device will return an error message if there is an issue with the user’s credential.\\
Rationale: The user should be notified with the issue, and may attempt to reset the credentials.\\
Associated Hazards: H3-2
\subsubsection{SR6}
The device will return an error message if the database has an overflow or mismatch.\\
Rationale: The user should be notified with the issue, and may attempt to find a solution for the issue.\\
Associated Hazards: H4-1, H4-2
\subsubsection{SR7}
The device will return an error message when the database cannot proceed large numbers of items in one frame.\\
Rationale: The system should have an opportunity to slice the job into small pieces and redo the task again.\\
Associated Hazards: H4-3
\subsubsection{SR8}
The device should have short circuit prevention.\\
Rationale: Short circuit prevention is employed to protect electrical devices.\\
Associated Hazards: H1-2

\subsection{Security Requirements}
\subsubsection{SR9}
The device will save user’s data periodically to the local file.\\
Rationale: In case of unexpected shutdown or loss of power. The user should be able to keep all information from the last step.\\
Associated Hazards: H3-1, H5-1
\subsubsection{SR10}
The device will return an error message if there is an authentication issue detected.
Rationale: The user should be notified that there is another user who logins in as a superuser. Then fix the account permission and undo all changes.
Associated Hazards: H3-3
\section{Roadmap}
The requirements outlined in this hazard analysis document will be implemented throughout the project's time line. The order of implementation of the failure listed in the following section will be determined by their severity, where higher severity failure would have higher priority.
