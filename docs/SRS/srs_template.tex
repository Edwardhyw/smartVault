\subsection{The Scope of Product}
\subsubsection{Finite State Machine Description}
To make the behaviour of the product to achieve the target task, the Finite State Machine is created to describe the behaviour with detailed description provided after the picture. 
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.7]{FSM.png}
    \caption{The Picture of Finite  State Machine}
\end{figure}
\textbf{Record Initial Condition:} The device will take a picture of the room as the initial position information for each object and save it to the database. \\\\
\textbf{Waiting for New Changes:} The device will wait for future operations made by human or changes of objects detected by the camera. \\\\
\textbf{Detect Object Movement:} When the device detects the movement of an object that is made by another object (for example, colliding with another object and fall), it will trace the new location oof the object. \\\\
\textbf{Detect Hand Movement:} When the device detects the movement of the user, it will track the movement of the hand to identify which object is being moved and remember its final location. \\\\
\textbf{Updating:} The device will record the updated information (including time, Location, picture of object, and so on) of the object into the database.\\\\
\textbf{Input Object Information} When the user want to find one object in the room, the user interface will ask the user to input information of the object (like size, color, last time saw it, and so on).\\\\
\textbf{Providing List and Wait Response:} After the user has input the information, the system will provide a list of objects with pictures that satisfy the input information.\\\\
\textbf{Provide Detailed Information:} WHen the user find the target object, the device will display the detailed information about the object like showing the current location on the screen. \\\\
\textbf{Pull Out Initial Picture:} When the object is not found in the list, the devide will display the picture taken just after the program starts to let the user find the object.\\\\
\textbf{Object Taken Out:} If the object is still not found, the system will think that the object is taken out of the room or is hidden behind another object. \\\\
\textbf{Rotate Camera:} If the device found the human body detected is not in thhe center of the screen or the camera is covered by something else, it will send signals to the motor to rotate the camera until problem sloved. 


\subsubsection{Individual Product Use Cases}
\begin{figure}[H]

The outmost large box shows the boundary for the whole system. All user can do is just to start and shut down the program. Th user can also find the target object by typing the information about the object and verify if the object is found. The system will interact with the environment by rotating its camera and detecting the movement of the object in the room. It will also ba able to update its database when the position of the object is changed.

\section{Appendix}

This section has been added to the Volere template.  This is where you can place
additional information.

\subsection{Symbolic Parameters}

The definition of the requirements will likely call for SYMBOLIC\_CONSTANTS.
Their values are defined in this section for easy maintenance.

\subsection{Reflection}

Our team consists of 5 mechatronics student and is developing a mechatronics system where both hardware and software components are essential for success. There are may different skills and knowledge that ties into the success of the project. Many of these required skills might new and unfamiliar to some of the group members. However, as this is a project over a span of 6 months, there are plenty of time and opportunities to pick up and master some new skills. The learning of such skills will be delegated to different team members and mastered by them before delivering and teaching others member about it.  

The project is heavily relying on a functional, reliable, and efficient software system that involve live time object detection and image processing. The coding will be done in Python, so each member needs to have adequate skill of programming in Python and able to develop and test a python program. Knowledge of image processing and object detection also should be acquired.  In order to master the skills for programming in python and image processing, team members should practice and conduct research on different object detection method. It is required for the assigned team members to compare and learn from different method and making sure that our chosen method would yield the best results given our requirements. This part of the learning is assigned to Edward, Peng and Jinhua. Edward has gained relevant knowledge through courses he took and projects he did. Peng and Jinhua have great enthusiasm for this topic and would like to conduct research on it. 

Another software component is the user interface. Members of the team should be able to build and maintain a working webpage using JavaScript. This skill is obtained by Edward through his co-op and other experiences. Erping and Jinhua also are assigned to perfect their abilities in such area. The path to success for this is to read relevant documents and tutorials, as well as practicing with small projects.
In order to communicate between the software and hardware, related programming skills are needed. Erping as the lead developer for this topic has multiple experiences and with the help of Guangwei who has exceptional skills in this field, they will be able to excel the required skills and guide other members of the team.  

On the hardware side, Guangwei will be the lead and responsible for the learning and teaching of the related skills. 3D modeling is needed for the building and 3D printing the camera mount. This skill is assigned to Guangwei and can be mastered through practicing and watching tutorials. Arduino board is the chosen board for handling the control of the motors and repositioning of the camera. Sufficient knowledge and skills to program Arduino is needed. This task is assigned to Erping and Guangwei. They both have experiences in this field and will be able to teach the rest of the team. Knowledge associated with handling motor movement is also needed and can be mastered by reviewing course notes and refreshing past knowledge. 

Aside from the hardware and software system, there are also skills associated with team management and team communication. In order to maintain a desired work plan and team coordination, it is important for all members of the team to possess the skills to work under a team environment. Members need to be comfortable and familiar with github and in order to excel, one must practice different github actions and commends. One also can improve on this by watching tutorial videos. Working in a team environment, it is important to have good communication skills and making sure people are on the same page. This can be mastered by actively engage in team meetings and ask for help when needed.  

To conclude, for a professional project like the capstone, there are many aspects to it and many skills are required. It is important to delegate different learning tasks to individual and be able to teach the new skillset to the rest of the team.
