\subsubsection{Work Partitioning}

\subsubsection{Individual Product Use Cases}

\section{Behavior Description}
\subsection{Assumptions and Dependencies}
\textbf{AD1:} The user can perform simple computer opertions.\\
\textbf{Rationale:} The user can type, moving mouse and clicking on the window.\\\\
\textbf{AD2:} The user can understand English.\\\\
\textbf{AD3:} The operation of the project should take place indoors with adequate lighting.\\\\
\textbf{AD4:} All objects can be seen by the product without hiding.\\\\
\textbf{AD5:} Every motion of the user can be seen by the device. 

\subsection{Finite State Machine Description}
To make the behaviour of the product to achieve the target task, the Finite State Machine is created to describe the behaviour with detailed description provided after the picture. 
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.7]{FSM.png}
    \caption{The Picture of Finite  State Machine}
\end{figure}
\textbf{Record Initial Condition:} The device will take a picture of the room as the initial position information for each object and save it to the database. \\\\
\textbf{Waiting for New Changes:} The device will wait for future operations made by human or changes of objects detected by the camera. \\\\
\textbf{Detect Object Movement:} When the device detects the movement of an object that is made by another object (for example, colliding with another object and fall), it will trace the new location oof the object. \\\\
\textbf{Detect Hand Movement:} When the device detects the movement of the user, it will track the movement of the hand to identify which object is being moved and remember its final location. \\\\
\textbf{Updating:} The device will record the updated information (including time, Location, picture of object, and so on) of the object into the database.\\\\
\textbf{Input Object Information} When the user want to find one object in the room, the user interface will ask the user to input information of the object (like size, color, last time saw it, and so on).\\\\
\textbf{Providing List and Wait Response:} After the user has input the information, the system will provide a list of objects with pictures that satisfy the input information.\\\\
\textbf{Provide Detailed Information:} WHen the user find the target object, the device will display the detailed information about the object like showing the current location on the screen. \\\\
\textbf{Pull Out Initial Picture:} When the object is not found in the list, the devide will display the picture taken just after the program starts to let the user find the object.\\\\
\textbf{Object Taken Out:} If the object is still not found, the system will think that the object is taken out of the room or is hidden behind another object. \\\\
\textbf{Rotate Camera:} If the device found the human body detected is not in thhe center of the screen or the camera is covered by something else, it will send signals to the motor to rotate the camera until problem sloved. 

\subsection{Use Case Diagram}
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.8]{Use.png}
    \caption{The Picture of Use Case Diagram}
\end{figure}
The Use Case Diagram shown above describes some actions that the user can interact with teh system. The line in the middle shows the boundaries between user and the internal program. The outmost large box shows the boundary for the whole system. All user can do is just to start and shut down the program. Th user can also find the target object by typing the information about the object and verify if the object is found. The system will interact with the environment by rotating its camera and detecting the movement of the object in the room. It will also ba able to update its database when the position of the object is changed.

\subsection{Reflection}

The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the
graduate attribute of Lifelong Learning.  Please answer the following questions:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What knowledge and skills will the team collectively need to acquire to
  successfully complete this capstone project?  Examples of possible knowledge
  to acquire include domain specific knowledge from the domain of your
  application, or software engineering knowledge, mechatronics knowledge or
  computer science knowledge.  Skills may be related to technology, or writing,
  or presentation, or team management, etc.  You should look to identify at
  least one item for each team member.
  \item For each of the knowledge areas and skills identified in the previous
