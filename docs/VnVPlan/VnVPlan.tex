\section{General Information}

\subsection{Summary}

\wss{The SmartVault project is a Mechatronics system that is able to assist user identify the location of assigned objects in a given area.}

\subsection{Objectives}

\wss{This document is intended to develop a systematic plan for testing the functionality of the system.It meant to show the system has met the requirements in both software and hardware aspects mentioned in requirements document.In this document, system test and unit test will be conducted to check the functionality of the system. Functional and non-functional requirements will be separated for testing for both section. By the end of testing process, it can be shown that the system is working properly and available for usage.}

\subsection{Relevant Documentation}

\wss{In this document, Requirements Document will be referenced where the tests will be conducted based on the system requirements.}

\citet{SRS}

\section{Plan}

\wss{Introduce this section.   You can provide a roadmap of the sections to
  come.}

\subsection{Verification and Validation Team}

\wss{You, your classmates and the course instructor.  Maybe your supervisor.
  You shoud do more than list names.  You should say what each person's role is
  for the project.  A table is a good way to summarize this information.}

\subsection{SRS Verification Plan}

\wss{List any approaches you intend to use for SRS verification.  This may just
  be ad hoc feedback from reviewers, like your classmates, or you may have
  something more rigorous/systematic in mind..}

\wss{Remember you have an SRS checklist}

\subsection{Design Verification Plan}

\wss{Plans for design verification}

\wss{The review will include reviews by your classmates}

\wss{Remember you have MG and MIS checklists}

\subsection{Implementation Verification Plan}

\wss{You should at least point to the tests listed in this document and the unit
  testing plan.}

\wss{In this section you would also give any details of any plans for static verification of
  the implementation.  Potential techniques include code walkthroughs, code
  inspection, static analyzers, etc.}

\subsection{Automated Testing and Verification Tools}

\wss{What tools are you using for automated testing.  Likely a unit testing
  framework and maybe a profiling tool, like ValGrind.  Other possible tools
  include a static analyzer, make, continuous integration tools, test coverage
  tools, etc.  Explain your plans for summarizing code coverage metrics.
  Linters are another important class of tools.  For the programming language
  you select, you should look at the available linters.  There may also be tools
  that verify that coding standards have been respected, like flake9 for
  Python.}

\wss{The details of this section will likely evolve as you get closer to the
  implementation.}

\subsection{Software Validation Plan}

\wss{If there is any external data that can be used for validation, you should
  point to it here.  If there are no plans for validation, you should state that
  here.}

How test will be performed: \wss{Test is proceeded during a normal working period where a physical impact will be applied to the hardware. The impact level is trying to simulate the damage that could possibily be done during normal functional period including dropping from the desk, over twisting the camera.

How test will be performed: \wss{Users will be asked to use the system to find different objects in the same assigned area and tester will record the time the system response. Then users will enter the same searching information while the objects are placed into another area (objects are all placed into the assigned area).

The maximum rotation speed must be slow enough such that it will not 
cause any security concern.
}

\section{Unit Test Description}

\wss{Reference your MIS and explain your overall philosophy for test case
  selection.}  
\wss{This section should not be filled in until after the MIS has
  been completed.}

\subsection{Unit Testing Scope}

\wss{What modules are outside of the scope.  If there are modules that are
  developed by someone else, then you would say here if you aren't planning on
  verifying them.  There may also be modules that are part of your software, but
  have a lower priority for verification than others.  If this is the case,
  explain your rationale for the ranking of module importance.}

\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

\wss{Most of the verification will be through automated unit testing.  If
  appropriate specific modules can be verified by a non-testing based
  technique.  That can also be documented in this section.}

\subsubsection{Module 1}

\wss{Include a blurb here to explain why the subsections below cover the module.
  References to the MIS would be good.  You will want tests from a black box
  perspective and from a white box perspective.  Explain to the reader how the
  tests were selected.}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{test-id1\\}

Type: \wss{Functional, Dynamic, Manual, Automatic, Static etc. Most will
  be automatic}
					
Initial State: 
					
Input: 
					
Output: \wss{The expected result for the given inputs}

Test Case Derivation: \wss{Justify the expected value given in the Output field}

How test will be performed: 
					
\item{test-id2\\}

Type: \wss{Functional, Dynamic, Manual, Automatic, Static etc. Most will
  be automatic}
					
Initial State:

Output: \wss{The expected result for the given inputs}

Test Case Derivation: \wss{Justify the expected value given in the Output field}

How test will be performed:

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Module 2}

...

\subsection{Tests for Nonfunctional Requirements}

\wss{If there is a module that needs to be independently assessed for
  performance, those test cases can go here.  In some projects, planning for
  nonfunctional tests of units will not be that relevant.}

\wss{These tests may involve collecting performance data from previously
  mentioned functional tests.}
