\section{Purpose}
This document is intended to support the systematic plan for testing the functionality of the system. It meant to show the system has met the requirements in both software and hardware aspects mentioned in requirements document. In particular, this document will describe the testing results. By the end of testing process, it can be shown that the system is working properly and available for usage.
\section{Scope}
The document would pay attention to the different functionalities being discussed within the VnVPlan documentation. In addition, it would undergo the testing processes as if it was a black box, which will emphasis on the inputs and outputs of the system instead of the internal process and mechanics.	
\section{Background}	
SmartVault is designed to assist the user to remember where his/her belongings are and the most recent time the user had used or placed their belongings. The proposed system is capable of tracking and following human activities to position itself best for capturing any moving objects caused by the user. The system will identify each item that is being moved and record/update their corresponding positions. The user then has the ability to interact with our system through an interface and select which item the user is looking for. Given this information, our system would identify where that specific item is and assist the user to locate their belongings in a short time.
This section will not be appropriate for every project.

\section{Changes Due to Testing}
Based on the feedback from Rev 0 demo, we have conducted our test case based on larger room with more complex background environments. During the early stages of testing process, performance reliability issues were found, which led to changes to the main algorithm which aims to lower the light sensitivity to increase the repeatability of the test cases.  \\
 
 Taking notes from our discussion with users, we tried to best limit the user interaction with the system. Users is only required to interact with the user interface which has adapted to user feedback to improve usability. \\
 
 Another point noted was that users would like to have more detailed time for searching specific items. This will be implemented in the upcoming milestone where some other quality of life update will be implemented. \\

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the
graduate attribute of Lifelong Learning.  Please answer the following questions:


\begin{enumerate}
  \item In what ways was the Verification and Validation (VnV) Plan different
  from the activities that were actually conducted for VnV?  If there were
  differences, what changes required the modification in the plan?  Why did
  these changes occur?  Would you be able to anticipate these changes in future
  projects?  If there weren't any differences, how was your team able to clearly
  predict a feasible amount of effort and the right tasks needed to build the
  evidence that demonstrates the required quality?  (It is expected that most
  teams will have had to deviate from their original VnV Plan.)
  
  
\end{enumerate}
 One of the biggest area of difference between VnV plan and VnV report is from some of the changes to the functional requirements. Our system is no longer tracking human hands, which reflected in the VnV report where we did not test that specific requirement. Another difference is that we modified the logic of camera and motor movement. The purpose of this modification is to satisfy the image process requirement, which cause we add a new requirement and test case compare with the VnV plan. What's more, The test for opening the technical support window is added because the path for the customer to ask help from the program developer is important. Since VnV plan was made prior to us finalizing the implementation, we had made several assumptions that were later modified. However, most of our VnV plan turned out to be feasible and essential for the validation of our project. Since we developed our testing plan based on input/outcome, the change to our anticipated algorithm did not affect the general path for our VnV report. The proposed testing case in VnV plan were tested and validated.
